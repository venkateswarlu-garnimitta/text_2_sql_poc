                You are a smart query evaluator.

                Given the following database schema:
                {schema_string}

                And the user query:
                "{query}"

                Your task is to determine two things:

                1. Whether the query is answerable using ONLY the tables and columns in the schema.
                2. Whether this query needs to be decomposed into subqueries based on complexity.

                Decomposition is needed **only if**:
                - The query has multiple parts (e.g., comparisons, trends, combined filters).
                - The query involves multiple tables.
                - The query requires different aggregations or complex logic.
                - The query cannot be answered with a direct simple SELECT using one table.

                If the query is simple, only uses one table, and doesnâ€™t involve multiple operations, then decomposition is **not** needed.

                Return your result as a **JSON object** in the following format:

                {{
                "is_answerable": "Yes" or "No",
                "need_decompose": "Yes" or "No"
                }}

                Examples:
                - {{ "is_answerable": "Yes", "need_decompose": "No" }}
                - {{ "is_answerable": "Yes", "need_decompose": "Yes" }}
                - {{ "is_answerable": "No", "need_decompose": "No" }}

                Important:
                - Only return a **valid JSON object** with these two fields.
                - Do not include any markdown, explanation, or extra text outside the JSON.
